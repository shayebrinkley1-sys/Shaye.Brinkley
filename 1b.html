<p> Take no prisoners for me
I'm told you're elevating
Drinks go straight to my knees
I'm sold, I'm going on clean
I'm going on clean
</p> <hr/>
<p>I've no more tricks up my sleeve
Game called review the player
Time codes and Tokyo scenes
Bad boys, it's complicated
It's complicated</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's best you know what you don't
Aperture lets the light in
It's best you know what you don't
Aperture lets the light in
</p>
<hr/>
<p>We belong together
It finally appears it's only love
We belong togethеr
We belong togethеr
It finally appears it's only love
We belong together</p>
<hr/>
<p>In no good state to receive
Go forth, ask questions later
Trap doors, you're toying with me
Dance halls, another cadence
</p>
<hr/>
<p><br/><b>It's best you know what you don't

<hr/>
<p>We belong together
It finally appears it's only love
We belong together
It finally appears
We belong together
It finally appears it's only love
We belong together</p>
<hr/>
<p>I won't stray from it
I don't know these spaces
Time won't wait on me
I wanna know what safe is
I won't stray from it
I don't know these spaces
Time won't wait on me
I won't stray from it
I don't know these spaces
Time won't wait on me
I wanna know what safe is
I won't stray from it
I don't know these spaces
Time won't wait on me</p>
<hr/>
<p>We belong together
It finally appears it's only love
We belong together
It finally appears
We belong together
It finally appears it's only love
